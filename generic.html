							<p><b>Bifunctional Material Design with Machine Learning:</b> I'm working with Professor Okolie from Chemical Engineering department to work on a project that aims on accelerating the process of capturing CO2 and converting it into sustainable products, providing a more efficient pathway to discovering high-performance materials. In this project, I will collect data on various bifunctional materials, use the collected data to train machine learning models, identifying patterns and predicting the performance of the new material combinations, analyze the relationship between material structures and their performance, and create a user-friendly GUI environment to enable researchers and engineers to design and optimize bifunctional materials based on the machine learning model predictions.</p>
							<p><b>Neuroimaging Data Analyst Research:</b> I'm working as an assistant for a Data Analyst research with University at Buffalo on the complexities of the internal mechanism that underlies pitch matching in singing. In this project, I will learn to carry out basic data preprocessing of neuroimaging (fMRI) data, arrange for the transmission of collected MRI and any behavioral data, and apply the data preprocessing pipeline to the collected MRI data and evaluate for data quality.</p>
							<p><b>Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter:</b> In this 7-week fellowship, I built and deployed 4 AI projects using React JS, Next.js, Firebase, Clerk, and Vercel, following agile methodologies with weekly sprints and incorporated CI/CD practices for iterative deployment. Out of these 4 projects, I built and deployed an interactive Inventory Management App using Next.js, Material-UI for UI and Firebase for backend database. Additionally, I worked in a team of 4 to develop an interactive customer support agent using Next.js, integrated a custom RAG pipeline using OpenAI and Pinecone that responds based on a company's knowledge. For the last project, I collaborated with another fellow to build and deploy a Saas product that generates dynamic flashcards based on any topic using the Llama 3.1 LLM via the Groq API, integrated a paywall and custom pricing plans using the Stripe API. I also participated in weekly sessions with engineers from Google, Y Combinator, Stanford, Amazon.</p>
							<p><b>Study Group Facilitator for CSCI203 and MATH202:</b> I am leading weekly study groups of 10 students in Intro to Computer Science and Calculus II; each one lasts 90 minutes. In these study groups, I focus on guiding peer learning and problem-solving skills, contributing to a significant improvement in students' understanding. Additionally, I am also working with a co-facilitator to align the CSCI203 study sessions with course objectives, enhancing my teamwork and leadership skills since I have learned a great deal from him. In the study sessions, I promote a culture of shared learning by encouraging knowledge sharing and cross-functional collaboration between students.</p>
