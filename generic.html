							<p><b>Student Grade Tracker:</b> In this project, I and my friend Ben create a system for grade-tracking since we know most of us only bother to calculate our grades around the time when finals are coming up since it is not convenient to calculate total grades manually. One of our main goals for the project is to create a Python application that enables students to efficiently track their grades. This means putting in place functionalities for adding new courses, accurately recording grades, computing overall course grades, and producing thorough grade summaries. Additionally, a well-designed user interface is essential for our project to guarantee accessibility and ease of use.</p>
							<p><b>Research assistant at Science and Engineering Fair:</b> I worked with my classmate to orchestrate the data collection, organization, and refinement of research data, adeptly curating representative graphs and charts to provide students in my high school with course materials for exam prep. This was an interesting project since I learned a lot more about digital libraries and it allowed me to work in a collaborative environment with others. Through this project, I was able to cultivate my skills in communication and teamwork. I was able to present this idea to teachers in my high school and students, which also enhanced my presentation skills.</p>
							<p><b>Teaching assistant at LearnSmart English Center:</b> During the summer break before my senior year in high school, I volunteered to work as a teaching assistant in a local English Center. In 3 months, I mentored over 100 students enrolled in an English program, explainin challenging concepts and fundamental English knowledge to elementary school students. Moreover, I also coordinated office hours and lesson plans in conjunction with 2 other Teaching Assistants to enhance the learning quality. This allowed me to get a hands-on experience of how to be a good teacher, preparing myself well enough for college.</p>
